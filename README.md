# üìå Tarea de Microservicios - Twitter API

## Description

This project implements an API to allow users to make posts, similar to Twitter. The application was initially developed as a monolith in Spring Boot and later refactored into a microservices architecture using AWS Lambda.
---

## Features

‚úÖ User registration and authentication.

‚úÖ Posting messages.

‚úÖ Storing posts in a single stream.

‚úÖ Web interface in JavaScript deployed on AWS S3.

‚úÖ Security implemented with JWT using Firebase Authentication.

‚úÖ Microservices-based architecture deployed on AWS Lambda.

---

## Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Spring Boot Monolith**:
    - Initially, the system was developed as a monolith handling the entities User, Post, and Stream.
    - The monolith is deployed on a local server or a service like AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
2. **Microservices**:
    - The monolith is divided into three independent microservices:
        - **User Service**: Handles user creation and authentication.
        - **Post Service**: Allows users to publish 140-character posts.
        - **Stream Service**: Maintains a unique thread of all published posts.
    - Each microservice is deployed on **AWS Lambda** and communicates via **API Gateway**.
3. **Web Application**:
    - A web application developed in **JavaScript** that consumes the services deployed on AWS Lambda.
    - The application is deployed on **Amazon S3** and is publicly available on the internet.
4. **Security**:
    - Authentication and authorization are implemented using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) with **AWS Cognito** or Firebase.

## **Entidades del Sistema**

The system is based on three main entities:

1. **Usuario**:
    - Represents a registered user on the platform.
    - Attributes:¬†`id`,¬†`username`,¬†`email`,¬†`password`.
2. **Post**:
    - Represents a 140-character message published by a user.
    - Attributes:¬†`id`,¬†`content`,¬†`userId`,¬†`streamId`.
3. **Stream**:
    - Represents a unique thread that contains all published posts.
    - Attributes:¬†`id`,¬†`posts`.

## Demonstration Videos of Development Steps

1. Design an API and create a Spring monolith that allows users to make 140-character posts and register them in a unique post stream (similar to Twitter). Consider three entities: User, Stream, and Post.

2. Create a JavaScript application to use the service. Deploy the application on S3. Ensure it is accessible over the internet.

3. Test the web application.

4. Add security using JWT with AWS Cognito or another technology.

6. Separate the monolith into three independent microservices using Lambda.
7. Deploy the service on AWS Lambda.

## **Monolith Deployment**

The monolith was developed using¬†**Spring Boot** and initially deployed on a local server or ¬†**AWS EC2**. Below are the steps to deploy the monolith:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nat15005/Taller-07-AREP.git
    cd Taller-07-AREP
    ```
    
2. **Build and run the monolith**:
    
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    
3. **Access the API**:
    - The API will be available at¬†`http://localhost:8080`.

---

## **Deployment on AWS Lambda**

The microservices were deployed on **AWS Lambda** using the **aws-serverless-java-container** adapter. Below are the steps to deploy a microservice:

1. **Package the microservice**:
    
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```
    
2. **Upload the JAR file to AWS Lambda**:
    - Upload the generated JAR file (`target/microservicio.jar`) to AWS Lambda.
3. **Configure the handlerr**:
    - Set up the (`Handler`) to point to the main class of the microservice (for example,¬†`arep.twitter.UserLambdaHandler`).
4. **Configure API Gateway**:
    - Create an API Gateway to expose the microservice's endpoints..

---

## **Microservices Separation**

The monolith was divided into three independent microservices:

1. **User Service**:
    - Handles user creation and authentication.
    - Deployed on AWS Lambda.
2. **Post Service**:
    - Allows users to publish 140-character posts.
    - Deployed on AWS Lambda.
3. **Stream Service**:
    - Maintains a unique thread of all published posts.
    - Deployed on AWS Lambda.

Each microservice communicates via **API Gateway** and uses **AWS Lambda** to execute business logic.

---

## **Web Application**

The web application was developed in **JavaScript** and deployed on **Amazon S3**. Below are the steps to deploy the application:

1. **Upload static files to S3**:
    - Upload the generated files (`build/`) to an S3 bucket.
2. **Enable public access**:
    - Configure the S3 bucket to be publicly accessible.
3. **Acceder a la aplicaci√≥n**:
    - The application will be available at the URL provided by S3 (e.g.,¬†`http://tu-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).

---

## **Testing**

Unit and integration tests were conducted for each system component. Below are the types of tests performed:

1. **Unit Tests**:
    - **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** were used to test individual classes and methods.
2. **Integration Tests**:
    - The integration between microservices and the web application was tested.
3. **Load Tests**:
    - **Apache JMeter** was used to simulate multiple users and verify system performance.

---

## **Security**

Security was implemented using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) with **AWS Cognito** or Firebase. Below are the steps to configure security:

1. **Set up AWS Cognito**:
    - Create a User Pool in AWS Cognito.
    - Configure the necessary clients and permissions.
2. **Integrate JWT into Spring Boot**:
    - Configure Spring Security to validate JWT tokens.
3. **Protect API endpoints**:
    - Secure API endpoints using annotations like`@PreAuthorize`.
